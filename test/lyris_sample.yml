# This is the Lyris config for your tests.  This runs your test against a real Lyris implementation, so make sure
# you're using a test list that won't mind having tons of users added and subtracted on a regular basis.
#
#   email_in_list => when testing mailings, this is where they will be sent to (this user is on your list)
#   email_not_in_list => another test email, but this email address isn't in your list
#   from: => used as the From: for those test mailings
